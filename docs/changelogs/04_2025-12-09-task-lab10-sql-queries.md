Task ID: lab10-sql-queries  
Status: Completed

Files Updated:
- CREATED: CS3220/lab10/lab10.sql

Summary:
1. Added lab10.sql containing the eight required SQL queries, each labeled with the question prompt.
2. Ensured every query adheres to the provided schema and uses only data stated in the questions.

Reasoning & Trade-offs:
- Used joins and EXISTS predicates where necessary to avoid relying on surrogate IDs, matching the assignment constraint.
- Applied DISTINCT when deduplication was required to keep result sets clean and aligned with question wording.

Issues Encountered:
- None.

Future Work:
- Optional: run the script against the sample schema to capture result screenshots for submission.
