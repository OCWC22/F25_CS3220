# Changelog: 03_2025-10-16 - LoginSession Auth UI Refresh (Task login-auth-ui)

**Task:** [login-auth-ui] Match LoginSession authentication screens to provided mockups  
**Status:** Done

### Files Updated:
- **UPDATED:** `workspace/LoginSession/src/main/webapp/index.jsp` – rebuilt login layout, messaging, and social icon markup to match mockups
- **UPDATED:** `workspace/LoginSession/src/main/webapp/register.jsp` – aligned registration form structure and helper copy with new design
- **UPDATED:** `workspace/LoginSession/src/main/webapp/css/styles.css` – replaced authentication styles with gradient background, card styling, and social icon treatments while preserving download styles

### Description:
Implemented the new login and registration UI shown in the provided mockups, including typography, card layout, social login icon placeholders, and CTA copy. Updated the shared stylesheet to support the refreshed visual design and ensured both JSPs reference the new classes.

### Reasoning:
Adapting the JSPs and CSS to the supplied design ensures the grading environment matches stakeholder expectations, maintains consistency across the auth flow, and keeps the styling centralized in `styles.css` for easier adjustments.

### Key Decisions & Trade-off:
- Used Font Awesome CDN for Facebook/X/Google icons to avoid bundling custom SVG assets while still matching the design.
- Preserved existing download-page classes to prevent regressions elsewhere in the app.
- Chose semantic helper classes (`auth-card`, `primary-button`, etc.) for readability and future reuse.

### Follow-up Actions:
- Verify the updated pages in Eclipse’s built-in browser and external browsers after redeploying via the Tomcat server controlled by Eclipse.
- Capture screenshots for submission if required by the assignment rubric.
